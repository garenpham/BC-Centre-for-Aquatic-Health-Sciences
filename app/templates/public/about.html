        <p>
          In British Columbia, salmon reared in a hatchery setting are exposed to conditions that are increasingly associated with climate change (physical, chemical, and biological stressors) that may favor some ubiquitous and endemic pathogens. This can result in proliferation and increased risk of infection and subsequent compromised fish health. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Rapid and accurate identification of the etiologic agents of infectious diseases is essential to make informed health management and treatment decisions.  Recently, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) applied directly to biological and environmental samples has become more commonly used for pathogen discovery and diagnostics in human and veterinary medicine. 
        </p>
        <p>
          At BC CAHS, we are applying Nanopore technology as a rapid and broad-range tool for the detection of salmon pathogens from biological (body fluids and organs) and environmental samples from hatcheries. We will use this technology for three applications: 1) broodstock screening, 2) examination of pathogen sources and distribution in hatchery systems and 3) to identify/characterize the agent/agents associated with disease occurrences.
        </p>
        <p>
          This study will develop and apply advanced sequence-based molecular tools to improve our understanding of the composition and dynamics of microbial communities present in hatcheries, and to support the refinement of hatchery and fish health management practices. The data generated by this study will be analyzed in conjunction with the routine screening tools including pathogen screening, clinical sign observations, histopathological and epidemiological data in order to make better informed health management decisions, to identify sources of infection, and improve facilities to reduce the occurrence of microbes of concern.
